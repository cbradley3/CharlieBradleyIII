# Self Promotion website with simple parallax scrolling features

I'm Charlie Bradley III, a visual artist, photographer and designer would has worked primarily in the print industry for nearly 20 years. I'm just getting my feet wet in web development. Hopefully my print design expertise will translate well, aesthetically, to my front end development skills going forward.

this website uses simple parallax scrolling and jump scrolling on the main page. It is responsive with the photo galleries being responsive also. All of the photography, design samples and artwork seen on the site was done by yours truly.

The first development project is a small sampling of what I've learned so for at Code Boot Camp at the Clubhouse and my instructor, Nadeem.
